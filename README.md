# Chimm - House Rental Site

This mini project was done for a CTE204 - Internet Technologies and Web Engineering module during my undergrad in B.E. Information Technology.

We were just supposed to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript but I added Firebase to make it dynamic. The project is simply a small Housing Rental Site.



Due to time constraint, some of the features are still missing like:

- Uploading photos of the house

- Displaying photo of that particular house in the marketplace

- Proper confirmation once the house is rented

- Contacting the owner

- Viewing other's profile

- Optimization of some firebase codes

Once I get some time, I am planning to complete these features.



The current version is live at - [Chimm (Current Version)](https://chimm.vercel.app)



Will try to develop the same project in my free time or soon move it to React.
