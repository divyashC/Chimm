# Chimm - House Rental Site

This mini project was done for a CTE204 - Internet Technologies and Web Engineering module during my undergrad in B.E. Information Technology.

We were just supposed to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript but I added Firebase to make it dynamic. The project is simply a small Housing Rental Site.
